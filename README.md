# hotkey

Hotkey.ahk is my personal AutoHotKey script for running applications in Windows 10, and doing a few things quickly with hotkeys. Use this script to automatically launch or switch to applications:

| Application        | Hotkey      |
| :----------------- | ----------- |
| Powershell         | Win+T       |
| Visual Studio Code | Win+V       |
| SciTE4AutoHotkey   | Win+H       |
| Explorer           | Win+E       |
| Excel              | Win+Shift+X |
| Word               | Win+Shift+W |
| Calculator         | Alt+C       |
| Google Chrome      | Win+Shift+C |
| Firefox            | Win+Shift+F |
| AutoCAD            | Win+Shift+A |

<br>Other useful functions:

| Function                   | Hotkey |
| :------------------------- | ------ |
| Kill the hokey script      | Win+X  |
| Minimize the active window | Win+M  |
| Close the active window    | Ctrl+Q |

<br>This script can also be used to open a desired folder in explorer.
E.g. press Win+C to open the C-Drive.<br>

To build from source, [install AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/) and compile hotkey.ahk, or just run the .exe if you trust me and don't want to make any modifications.
